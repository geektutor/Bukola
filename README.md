# Bukola

Bukola is a simple WordPress boilerplate I built based on EA Genesis Child by Bill Erickson
(https://www.billerickson.net/genesis-base-child-theme/)

## How to use?

Clone the repo

Add your own additional styling file to the theme's home directory(styles.css)

Duplicate the temp.php in a new file (for example about.php)

Rename the template name on line 3

Add the url of your stylesheet file on line 11(yourwebsite.com/wp-content/themes/Bukola/styles.css)

Add your body code

Zip the whole Bukola folder and upload to your dashboard

## Roadmap

1. A non-Genesis version
